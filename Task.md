help me do this assignment being fully data driven. Like a BCG or a McKinsey senior consultant, choose a dataset now, and we will do some operations on the dataset and then we will visualize it (plot curves, etc.). Very advanced as a BCG or a McKinsey. Now, let's discuss what datasets are there online and help me. I will choose come up with all the available things that we'll be able to download and do: "Description

This individual assignment guides you through the process of creating your own high-impact data visualization that applies key principles of telling a story with data. This assignment has two parts. You will first create two data visualizations based on your own research findings or data you have identified about your final project topic. Next, you will reflect on the visualizations you created by answering a series of questions that explain the reasoning and choices for your chosen visualizations. 

Data Visualization Creation

Create two data visualizations based on your research findings or important data relevant to your final project topic. The degree of complexity for your data visualizations is entirely up to you. You can create using PowerPoint, Tableau, Microsoft Word, Excel, or even free-hand drawing. Your goal is to increase understanding of your data and use the data to tell a story while applying principles of good data visualization. Consider the following helpful questions when planning your data visualization:

What's the topic or issue I'm exploring?
Who's the audience? What do they care about? What do I need them to know?
What’s the story in my data? Why am I using data visualization to explain this?
What colors (if any) have symbolic meaning—both positive and negative—for this topic?
What are some icons or images that have symbolic meaning for this topic?
What type of graph or chart can best convey this data?
In addition to exploring these questions, please review the grading criteria below when creating your visualizations. 

 

Data Visualization Reflection

After creating your graphics, reflect by answering the following questions briefly (approx. 300-800 words) in writing.

How does this graphic enhance comprehension of your findings?
What elements of your graphic will increase the retention of your findings?
How have you considered your particular audience when creating your visualization? As examples, did you account for:
Where they’re from?
Whether or not they work in the field?
Whether or not they’re in a position of power?
How educated are they?
If they’re skeptics?
How they’ll be viewing the information?
How did you intentionally design your visualization to increase the speed of understanding?
It is not necessary to summarize or explain the information conveyed by your data visualizations in your written reflections. Instead, your written answers should reflect how/why you made particular decisions while designing your visualizations. 

 

What to Submit

Submit your two data visualizations and the written answers to the above reflection questions in a single pdf format document.

Note. This is an individual assignment. It is recommended that you complete this assignment independent from your teammates (though you may need to share data with one other). The purpose in doing this separately is that you may learn from each other as each member may choose to visualize different findings and in different ways.

Brainstorm? : "India’s MSME ecosystem leaves a rich paper-trail in open-data portals, making it possible to build a board-room-ready “story with data” that links **enterprise births, credit flow, and export performance**.  Below you’ll find (1) the best publicly downloadable datasets, (2) two consultant-style narratives you can develop into the required visualisations, and (3) a step-by-step technical game-plan for getting the graphics and reflection PDF out the door.

## 2  Two consultant-grade storylines & visual concepts

### **Narrative A – “Credit-hungry growth”**

**Hypothesis :**  As MSME registrations surge post-2020, states receiving proportionately higher bank credit see faster job generation.

| Visual 1 (attention grabber)                                                                                                                                 | Visual 2 (deep dive)                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Choropleth map** – YoY % growth in Udyam registrations by state (2021 → 2024). The colour ramp spotlights outlier states like Tamil Nadu or Uttar Pradesh. | **Bubble-scatter** – X-axis : cumulative registrations, Y-axis : RBI credit outstanding; bubble size = jobs reported. 45° line shows which states are “over/under-funded.” |

*Data needed :* #1 + #3 + #7.

### **Narrative B – “From local shop to global shipper”**

**Hypothesis :**  A small cadre of product groups and export destinations account for most of MSME export value, hinting at diversification risk.

| Visual 1                                                                                                                                 | Visual 2                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pareto bar-line** – Top-10 product categories vs cumulative % of MSME exports; secondary axis traces changing share 2019–20 → 2023–24. | **Sankey / chord diagram** – Flow from top 7 states → top 10 destination countries (value ₹ crore), revealing strategic corridors. |

*Data needed :* #5 + #6 (+ optional #9 for product detail).

## 3  Design choices that raise C-suite comprehension speed

1. **Colour semantics** – Green palette for credit-adequate states, deep red for gaps; blue hues for export markets to avoid fiscal connotations.
2. **Pre-attentive labelling** – Directly print state ISO codes or product names on extreme data points to kill legend-hunting.
3. **Gestalt consistency** – Same geographic projection and aspect ratio across map & Sankey boosts pattern recognition.
4. **Accessibility** – Pass WCAG 2.1 contrast; add hover tool-tips (Tableau or Plotly) for exact ₹ values.
5. **Annotation layer** – Call-out FY 2023 policy shifts (e.g., CGTMSE guarantee hike, export incentive tweaks) to anchor causal inference. ([Wikipedia][12])

## 4  Technical execution roadmap (what you’ll actually do)

### **Step 1 – Extract & stage**

```bash
# Example: pull Udyam registrations
wget -O udyam.csv "https://api.data.gov.in/resource/udyam-registration?api-key=YOURKEY&format=csv"
# RBI credit (state sheet)
curl -o credit.xlsx https://dbie.rbi.org.in/STATE_CREDIT.xlsx
```

Load both into a DuckDB database for fast joins (`CREATE TABLE udyam AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('udyam.csv');`).

### **Step 2 – Transform**

* Parse dates, derive FY, normalise state names to ISO codes.
* Aggregate Udyam counts and jobs by state-FY; convert RBI credit to ₹ crore.
* Compute “Credit per new MSME” KPI.

### **Step 3 – Model & sanity-check**

* Correlation heat-map between credit intensity and job growth.
* Tukey box-plots to spot data entry outliers (e.g., Lakshadweep zeros).

### **Step 4 – Visualise**

* **Python / Plotly** for interactive map and bubble-scatter (saves as SVG/PNG).
* Export images to PowerPoint or directly lay out in Tableau Story with captions.

### **Step 5 – Write 300--800 word reflection**

Address: audience profile (e.g., Ministry officials vs SME bankers), visual tone, speed-to-insight tactics, retention hooks (colour semantics, memorable KPI).

### **Step 6 – Package**

Combine two high-resolution graphics + reflection essay into a single PDF (`export to PDF` in PowerPoint or `weasyprint` if using HTML).
